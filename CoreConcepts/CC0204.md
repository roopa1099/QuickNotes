## SpringBoot

1. Autoconfiguration: Springboot does auto configuration based on depdencies in classpath, also scns configuration classes and creates beans as per defined. For example if we add h2db dependency, it creates all required beans for in memory storage and configures the h2 database.

2. Springboot has starter dependencies which helps in adding basic dependencies for web development, data access and spring security.

3. Spring Boot includes an embedded servlet container (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) that allows you to run your application as a standalone JAR file without the need for an external application server. If we want to disable embedded depndency this is how we do:
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>

4. Spring MVC: Spring Boot supports the Spring MVC framework for building web applications.

5. @Controller is a stereotype annotation used to mark a class as a Spring MVC controller. It is typically used in traditional web applications where you need to generate HTML views. We need to add @Response body to tell spring to serialize response to JSON.

6. @RestController is a specialized version of @Controller that is used for creating RESTful web services.
It combines @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations, which means that the return value of the methods is directly written to the HTTP response body as JSON or XML (usually JSON by default). It's commonly used in applications where the client expects data (typically JSON or XML) rather than HTML views.

7. Spring Data JPA: Spring Boot integrates with Spring Data JPA, which simplifies data access through the use of JPA (Java Persistence API) and provides support for CRUD operations.

8. Spring Security: Spring Boot provides integration with Spring Security for securing your application. Annotations like @EnableWebSecurity and @Secured are commonly used for configuring security. 
They are used to configure and secure web applications by controlling access to various resources based on user roles and permissions.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
    </dependency>

**** This is how spring security works*******

a. Authentication: When a user logs in to your application, Spring Security authenticates the user by verifying their credentials (e.g., username and password) against a user store.

b. Authorization: After successful authentication, Spring Security retrieves the user's roles from the user store and associates them with the authenticated user. These roles are typically stored as Granted Authorities (sometimes referred to as Authorities or simply Roles).

c. Access Control: When a user tries to access a secured method or endpoint, Spring Security checks if the user has the necessary roles (Granted Authorities) to access that resource. If the user has the required roles, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.

*********************************************

9. @EnableWebSecurity: When applied to a configuration class or a configuration bean, it enables Spring Security's web security features, allowing you to configure authentication, authorization, and other security-related settings for web requests. It isclasslevel annotation.
Goes hand-in-hand with a configuration class that extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, where you can override methods to customize security behavior.

    @SpringBootApplication
    @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
    public class MyApplication {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
        }
    }

    @Configuration
    @EnableWebSecurity
    public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

     @Override
     protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        // Configure in-memory authentication with a single user
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user")
            .password("{noop}password")
            .roles("USER");
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        // Configure HTTP security
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll() // Allow access to public endpoints
            .anyRequest().authenticated() // Require authentication for all other requests
            .and()
            .formLogin(); // Use default form login
    }
}

You can now create your controller classes and define endpoints as usual. Security rules defined in the SecurityConfig class will be applied to these endpoints.


10. @Secured: It is a method-level security annotation used to control access to specific methods or endpoints based on user roles. Apply @Secured to methods or endpoints in your Spring MVC controllers to restrict access only to users with specific roles. Users must have at least one of the specified roles to access the annotated method or endpoint. 
You might have additional access control requirements specific to certain methods within the controller that are not covered by the global configuration. In such cases, you can use @Secured or other method-level security annotations to define these additional constraints.

        @RestController
        @RequestMapping("/api")
        @Secured("ROLE_ADMIN")
        public class MyController {

            @GetMapping("/secured")
            public String securedEndpoint() {
                return "This endpoint is secured";
            }
        }

11. Types of dependency injection supported in springboot:
    a. Contructor based: through a class constructor(Most preferred).
            @Service
            public class MyService {
                private final MyRepository myRepository;

                public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
                    this.myRepository = myRepository;
                }
            }

    b. Setter Injection:

        @Service
        public class MyService{
            private Service service;

            @Autowired
            public void setService(Service service){
                this.service=service
            }
        }
    
    c. Field Injection(Least preferred):

        @Autowired
        private Service service;

12. Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to monitor and manage your application. Annotations like @EnableActuator allow you to expose endpoints for metrics, health checks, and more.Spring Boot Actuator is automatically enabled in your application. Access Actuator endpoints by appending /actuator to your application's base URL. 


13. Spring Boot allows you to externalize configuration properties from your application code using properties files, YAML files, or environment variables. Annotations like @ConfigurationProperties are used to map properties to Java objects.

    @Component
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "myapp")
    public class MyAppProperties {
    private String name;
    private int version;
    private String description;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getVersion() {
        return version;
    }

    public void setVersion(int version) {
        this.version = version;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }
}

    # application.properties
    myapp.name=My Spring Boot App
    myapp.version=1
    myapp.description=This is a sample Spring Boot application.

14. In Spring Boot, a bean refers to an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. These beans are created, configured, and managed by the Spring framework, allowing for easy dependency injection and lifecycle management.

## Annotation
1. @SpringBootApplication: Main annotation to mark a class as a Spring Boot application.

2. @RestController: Combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody, used to create RESTful web services.

3. @Service: Indicates that a class provides a business service. Spring automatically detects and registers the annotated class as a Spring bean in the application context, allowing it to be injected into other components using dependency injection. 
When you annotate a service with @Service, you can apply transactional behavior to its methods using @Transactional, ensuring that multiple database operations within a single service method are executed within the same transaction. This is the business logic layer.
Represent business services or service layer components

4. @Repository: Indicates that a class provides data access functionality. When you annotate a class with @Repository, Spring enables this exception translation mechanism for the annotated class, simplifying error handling in your application. This is data access layer.

5. @Component: General-purpose stereotype annotation for Spring-managed components. @Component serves as a parent stereotype annotation for other specialized stereotype annotations, such as @Service, @Repository, and @Controller. Spring provides various mechanisms for customizing and configuring components annotated with @Component, such as specifying bean names, scopes, and initialization parameters. Used in utility classes.

        @Component("customBeanName")
        public class MyComponent {
            // Component implementation
        }

        @Component
        public class AnotherComponent {

             private final MyComponent customBean;

            @Autowired
            public AnotherComponent(@Qualifier("customBeanName") MyComponent customBean) {
                this.customBean = customBean;
            }

            // Component implementation
        }

6. @Configuration: Indicates that a class contains Spring configuration. Overwrites the bean creation and return object as per required/our choice. The return type should be compatible with original bean creation.

7. @EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism. When you add @EnableAutoConfiguration to your main application class, Spring Boot scans the classpath for configuration classes and automatically configures beans, infrastructure components, and other settings based on the detected environment and dependencies.

8. @RequestMapping: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods. Explicitly specify the http method.

        @RequestMapping(value = "/path", method = RequestMethod.GET)

9. @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping: Shortcut annotations for specifying HTTP methods.

10. @RequestParam: Binds request parameters to method parameters.

11. @PathVariable: Extracts values from URI templates.

    @DeleteMapping(path = "course/{courseId}")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteCourse(
        @PathVariable
        UUID courseId,  @RequestParam(defaultValue = "0")
        int age, @RequestBody Type json) throws NyfcException {}

12. @Autowired: Autowires dependencies by type.

13. @Value: Injects values from properties files or environment variables.

14. @Transactional: It informs Spring that a method, or all methods in a class, should be executed within a transactional context. Transactions ensure that a series of operations are treated as a single unit of work, either all succeeding or all failing, providing data integrity and consistency.

   @Transactional
    public void performTransactionalOperation() {
        // Perform database operations
        myRepository.save(entity1);
        myRepository.save(entity2);
    }

15. @ControllerAdvice: (Custom Error Handling)Annotaiion to enable globa exception handling. Wedefine error handlers for particuar exception class here.

        @ControllerAdvice
        public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

            @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
            public String handleException(Exception ex) {
                // Handle all exceptions globally
                return "error"; // Forward to error view
            }
        }

16. @RequiredArgsConstructor: Generates a constructor for a class with required fields as parameters. 

17. @AllArgsConstructor: Generates a constructor for a class with all fields as parameters.
