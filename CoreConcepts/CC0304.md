## IOC

 1. With IoC, the control flow is inverted, meaning that a framework or container controls the flow and calls into application code as needed.

 2. We let Spring Boot inject an instance of the appropriate service implementation into the constructor using the @Autowired annotation. 

 3. We do not manage the object creation by instantiating the dependent services, we let springbot manage it.

    @Autowired
    public Application(MessageService messageService) {
        this.messageService = messageService;
    }

MessageService messageService is a parameter of the constructor. Spring will look for a bean that implements the MessageService interface and pass it as an argument when creating an instance of the Application class.

## JPA/Hibernate

1. Way of managing, persisting data between java object and relational database. It is a ORM. ORMs are implemened uses JDBC imnternaly.

2. Provides annotation to create and map entity class to database tables.

3. JPA simplifies interaction with relational database by providing high level abstraction over sql queries.

4. Annotations in JPA : @Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column,@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY), etc.

5. @Entity maps the class to the table. That is, the table name is User in the below example:

    @Entity
    class User{

        @Id
        UUID id;
        String name;
        String class;
    }

6. @Table is used to provide extra details to table like table name, schema name, define indexes etc.

        @Table(name = "users", schema = "my_schema")

5. Dependency for hibernate: spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

6. Hibernate is an implementation of jpa.

7. Important concepts of Hibernate:
    a. Entity Manager: Manages the mapping between entoty class and relational database.

    b. Session Factory: Manages database connection and entity mappings. SessionFactory provides the instance of Session.

    c. Session: in Hibernate represents a single database connection and transaction. It provides methods for performing database operations like saving, updating, retrieving, and deleting entities. 

        Session.createSQLQuery

    d. Transaction:Hibernate supports transaction management to ensure data consistency and integrity. You can begin, commit, or rollback transactions using the Session object. Hibernate automatically manages transaction boundaries and ensures that database operations are atomic and consistent.

    e. Query Language: Hibernate provides HQL (Hibernate Query Language), an object-oriented query language similar to SQL but based on entity classes and their relationships.

8. Hibernate offers a wide range of features beyond the JPA specification, including lazy loading, caching, batch processing, criteria queries, and more. It provides its own set of annotations and configuration options for fine-tuning the mapping and behavior of entities.

9. JPA provides a standardized API for performing common database operations, such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), querying data, managing transactions, and defining entity mappings.

10. Mapping:One to One: This is bidirectional.

    @Entity
    public class Person {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "person", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Address address;

    // Constructors, getters, setters
}


    @Entity
    public class Address {
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private Long id;
        private String street;
        private String city;

        @OneToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "person_id")
        private Person person;

        // Constructors, getters, setters
    }

11. In unidirection only person will have reference to adress using @JoinClumn(name=''), in bidirectonal both will have reference to eah other.

12. One to many mapping:

    @Entity
    public class Employee {
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private Long id;
        private String name;

        @ManyToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
        private Department department;

        // Constructors, getters, setters
    }

    @Entity
    public class Department {
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private Long id;
        private String name;

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
        private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

        // Constructors, getters, setters
    }

13. Casade: All, Remove, Persist, Merge.


## Multithreading

1. Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.

2. Create a thread by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface and passing it to a Thread object.
        class MyThread extends Thread {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Thread running");
            }
        }

        public class ThreadExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                MyThread thread = new MyThread();
                thread.start();
            }
        }


        class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
             public void run() {
                 System.out.println("Runnable running");
            }
        }

        public class RunnableExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
                Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
                thread.start();
            }
        }

3. States of thread:
    New: The thread is created but not yet started.

    Runnable: The thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.(.start())

    Blocked/Waiting: The thread is waiting for a resource or a condition to be satisfied. (.join())

    Timed Waiting: The thread is waiting for a specified amount of time.(.sleep(222))

    Terminated: The thread has finished executing.

4. Thread Synchronization: In a multithreaded environment, it's essential to synchronize access to shared resources to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency. Java provides synchronized blocks and methods, as well as the synchronized, volatile keyword, to achieve thread synchronization.

      Example 1:

    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;

        public void increment() {
            synchronized (this) {
                count++; // Only one thread can execute this block at a time
            }
        }

        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }

    Example 2:

    class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object(); // Object for synchronization

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (lock) {   // this is how we acquire lock
            count++;
        }
    }

    // Other methods...
}

    Example 3:

    public static void increment() {
     synchronized (Counter.class) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    Example 4:

    public synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
    }

    Example 5:
    public class VolatileExample {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void toggleFlag() {
        flag = !flag; // Toggle the value of the volatile variable
    }
    }

Volatile keyword is used in Java to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by different threads asynchronously. It ensures that any thread reading the variable will see the most recent write operation performed by any other thread.

It's important to note that volatile does not provide atomicity for compound operations (such as incrementing or decrementing a variable), nor does it provide mutual exclusion (synchronization) to prevent race conditions

5. Thread Safety: A piece of code is considered thread-safe if it behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads concurrently. To ensure thread safety, you may need to use synchronization techniques such as locks, mutexes, or atomic operations.

6. Concurrency Issues: Deadlcok, starvation

7. Starvation happens when a thread is unable to access a shared resoource. It can happen even after use of volatile.

    public class StarvationExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Runnable task = () -> {
                synchronized (StarvationExample.class) {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired the lock.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some processing time
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            };

            // Create multiple threads with different priorities
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                Thread thread = new Thread(task);
                thread.setPriority(i); // Set priority (1: lowest, 5: highest)
                thread.start();
            }
        }
    }

     The threads have different priorities set (from 1 to 5). However, due to the way the operating system schedules threads, lower priority threads may be starved if higher priority threads continually acquire the lock.

8. Thread Pooling: Thread pooling is a technique used to manage and reuse a pool of threads to improve performance and reduce overhead associated with thread creation. Java provides the ExecutorService framework, which allows you to create and manage thread pools efficiently.

           public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool of size 3
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit tasks for execution
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " started by thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                try {
                    // Simulate some work
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " completed by thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        // Shutdown the executor once all tasks are complete
        executor.shutdown();

        try {
            // Wait for all tasks to complete or timeout after 5 seconds
            executor.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("All tasks have completed.");
    }

9. Daemon Threads: Daemon threads are background threads that run intermittently in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection or periodic maintenance. They do not prevent the JVM from exiting if all user threads have finished execution.
 
10. The primary use of ConcurrentHashMap is to provide a thread-safe implementation of the Map interface in Java, allowing multiple threads to access and modify the map concurrently without the need for external synchronization. 
Concurrent hash map makes the data consistent by keeping in map and hence making thread safe.

11. Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3);
        Runnable task = () -> {
            try {
                semaphore.acquire(); // Acquire permit
                System.out.println("Task executed");
                semaphore.release(); // Release permit
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        };
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        executorService.submit(task);
        executorService.submit(task);
        executorService.submit(task);
        executorService.shutdown();

Controls access to a shared resource by allowing a fixed number of threads to enter a critical section simultaneously.

12. Executor:

An Executor manages the execution of asynchronous tasks. It abstracts away the details of thread creation and management, allowing you to focus on the logic of your tasks.

    Example:

    Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
    executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Task executed asynchronously"));

13. ExecutorService:

An ExecutorService extends Executor and provides additional methods for managing tasks' lifecycle, like submitting tasks for execution and awaiting their completion.

Example:

        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        Future<String> future = executorService.submit(() -> "Task executed asynchronously");
        System.out.println(future.get()); // Waits for task to complete and retrieves the result
        executorService.shutdown();

It defines methods for submitting tasks for execution (submit() and invokeAll()), querying the status of tasks (isShutdown() and isTerminated()), and controlling the lifecycle of the executor (shutdown() and awaitTermination()).

The invokeAll() method submits all the tasks to the ExecutorService for execution.

It waits until all tasks have completed execution or until a timeout occurs.

Once all tasks have completed (or the timeout has occurred), invokeAll() returns a list of Future objects, one for each submitted task. These Future objects represent the results of the tasks, and you can use them to retrieve the task results or handle any exceptions that occurred during task execution.

14. Countdown: A CountDownLatch allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations in other threads completes. It maintains a count that decreases with each operation completion.

        Example:

        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);
        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println("Task executed");
            latch.countDown();
        };
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        executorService.submit(task);
        executorService.submit(task);
        executorService.submit(task);
        latch.await(); // Waits until count reaches zero
        executorService.shutdown();.
